== Entities
The entities defined in the com.csoftz.poc.jpa.entity come from the many articles in link section.

In some situations an entity may collide, thus its name is thus derived from article it derives, e.g.,
_JBeatEmployeeEntity_ and _JBeatAddressEntity_ are the ones taken from _'Spring Data JPA Tutorial'_
